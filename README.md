# TE_myrtle_rust

This is a repository describing the transposable element analysis in the Austropuccinia psidii linked to the preprint https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.996108 and following.  

The specific notebooks are:

* MRv01_TE_filtering_and_summary_v2. 
  This describes the TE coverage analysis followed by the REPET outputs.
  
* MRv01_TE_variation_analysis. 
  This describes the variation analysis including relative genome coverage by TE 'age' as measured by % identitiy relative to the consensus sequence, GC-content of TE consensus sequences grouped by 'age', AT-rich regions.
  
* MRv01_dinuc_counting. 
  This describes the analysis of RIP 'indeces' and depletion of CG/GC dinucleodites from TE copies of older TE families.

* MRv01_effector_analysis. 
  This describes the gene location analysis relative to each other and grouped in certain gene 'families'.
  
  Much of the analysis was inspired by the following publications:
  
  "The Parauncinula polyspora Draft Genome Provides Insights into Patterns of Gene Erosion and Genome Expansion in Powdery Mildew Fungi", 10.1128/mBio.01692-19.  
  and.  
  "Ancestral repeats have shaped epigenome and genome composition for millions of years in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>", 10.1038/ncomms5104.
